# Orange Loop: Five Notations of the Same Music

The 7-node architecture can be expressed through different lenses. Each version is structurally identical but framed for different modes of understanding.

## VERSION 1 — Technical / Engineering Notes
*   **Node 4 – Qwen Sentinel (Wire)**: Pre-process input, Post-process output, Always-on gate.
*   **Left Brain**: DeepSeek-R1 (Reasoning), DeepSeek-Coder (Logic).
*   **Right Brain**: Qwen2.5-1.5B (Gem), Gemma-2-2B (Tone).
*   **Acceleration**: SmolLM-1.7B (Fast responses).
*   **Flow**: Input → Sentinel → {R1 | Coder | Qwen | Smol} → (Gemma optional) → Sentinel → Output.

## VERSION 2 — Human / Cognitive Notes
*   Sentinel listens first, and speaks last.
*   DeepSeek thinks in silence: one side asks why, one side asks how.
*   Qwen (Gem) turns thought into words.
*   Gemma makes the words kind.
*   Smol answers when speed matters more than depth.

## VERSION 3 — Anatomical / Body Notes
*   **Sentinel**: Spinal cord (signal in, signal out).
*   **DeepSeek-R1**: Left hemisphere (reason).
*   **DeepSeek-Coder**: Right hemisphere (structure).
*   **Qwen2.5**: Mouth + Ears (Gem).
*   **Gemma**: Facial expression.
*   **Smol**: Reflexes.
*   *Nothing speaks without passing through the spine. Nothing thinks without a hemisphere.*

## VERSION 4 — Operational / Daily Use Notes
1.  Ask the question.
2.  Run Sentinel quickly to classify: thinking? building? talking? fast?
3.  Send it to:
    *   DeepSeek-R1 for deep answers.
    *   DeepSeek-Coder for code.
    *   Qwen2.5 for normal conversation.
    *   Smol for quick checks.
4.  If it feels cold → rephrase through Gemma.
5.  Let Sentinel clean it before final output.

## VERSION 5 — Symbolic / Note-Card Version
*   **Sentinel** = Wire
*   **DeepSeek** = Mind
*   **Qwen** = Voice
*   **Gemma** = Heart
*   **Smol** = Speed
*   **Formula**: Wire → Mind → Voice → Heart → Wire (or Wire → Speed → Wire).

**Unifying Sentence**: DeepSeek decides, Qwen expresses, Gemma humanizes, Smol accelerates, Sentinel connects everything.
